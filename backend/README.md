Here's an updated `backend/README.md` with a more comprehensive installation guide and setup instructions for a Flask application. This version assumes you're using virtual environments and a requirements file to manage dependencies.

### `backend/README.md`

```markdown
# Backend

This directory contains the server-side code for the Kilimani Issues Reporting System, built using Flask. It handles API endpoints for reporting issues, contacting administrators, and managing other backend functionalities.

## Directory Structure

- **`app.py`**: The main Flask application file that sets up the server and routes.
- **`config.py`**: Configuration settings for the Flask application.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the Python packages required for the backend.
- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- **`README.md`**: This file provides an overview of the backend and its setup.

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to set up the backend environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd KilimaniHackathon/backend
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required Python packages using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Flask Application**

   Start the Flask server:

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

   The server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Configuration

- **`config.py`**: Modify this file for configuration settings such as database connections or API keys.

## Endpoints

- **`/submit-issue`**: Handles issue reports from the frontend.
- **`/submit-contact`**: Handles contact form submissions.
- **`/submit-report`**: Handles general report submissions.

## Development Tips

- **Testing**: Ensure your code is properly tested. Consider using tools like `pytest` for unit testing.
- **Debugging**: Run the Flask application in debug mode by setting `app.run(debug=True)` in `app.py` for more detailed error messages during development.

## Contributing

Contributions to the backend code are welcome. Please follow standard practices for Python development and Flask applications.

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create your own copy of the repository.
2. **Create a Branch**: Develop features or fix bugs in a separate branch.
3. **Submit a Pull Request**: Describe your changes and request a review.
